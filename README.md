1. Install Tampermonkey extension
2. Install extension via link https://github.com/githubfreedcamp/freedcamp-userscripts/raw/master/Freedcamp%20project%20colors.js
3. There are 3 options to select from and it works by changing card colors on projects board and nside file picker drop down.
4. You have "Select Mode", 'Color Opacity' and "Config" optios when you are on the Project Board https://freedcamp.com/dashboard

I asked @HackerM00n to add another option "Highlight all projects by their color" and a global setting 'Site URL" with default value 'freedcamp.com' so it worls for our white label customers as well.
